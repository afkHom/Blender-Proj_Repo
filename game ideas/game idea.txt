Game engine: Unity, im not comfortable with unreal just yet
Game Name: Morning Glory
Game start:Could possibly be normal by just having you go to the grocery store, very
linear only a one track. Then when the trigger at the store front is hit the
bounding box gets lifted and the player is free to do what they want.
soundtrack: Cheery, happy go lucky, like nothing in the world could ever go wrong.
About: Instead of massacare. Upon being hit with a paintball the neighbor could raise
his hand and shout "Howdy neighbor"
length: Short, condensed into one scene maybe.
title screen: Camera pans up to an empty bed, windows closed but curtains open
letting in sunlight.
Menu: The menu would feature only one button, maybe. One button that says
"Start your day!" which would then load the scene.
Animations: not sure just yet, well have to get a working build first
Neighborhood:Just your casual white picket fence neighborhood, maybe even a coldesack
assets: Sourced from the unity asset store and made by me or tyler/justin
Time to Make: probably weeks or months.


// possibility of it being a project is low because it involves guns
   but loopholes could be made possibly
